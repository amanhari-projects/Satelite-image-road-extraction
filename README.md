# Satelite-image-road-extraction
The file is based on a published paper cited as: (Even though slight variations are there)
"Z. Zhang, Q. Liu and Y. Wang, "Road Extraction by Deep Residual U-Net," in IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters, vol. 15, no. 5, pp. 749-753, May 2018, doi: 10.1109/LGRS.2018.2802944."
Variations include:
1. The loss function as changed into binary cross entropy rather mean squared error.
2. Iterations have been stopped at 15 rather at 50 since due to comutation limit.
